Objective:
Leverage ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques to forecast future exchange rates based on historical data provided in the exchange_rate.csv dataset. 
Dataset:
The dataset contains historical exchange rate with each column representing a different currency rate over time. The first column indicates the date, and second column represent exchange rates USD to Australian Dollar.
Part 1: Data Preparation and Exploration
1.	Data Loading: Load the exchange_rate.csv dataset and parse the date column appropriately.
2.	Initial Exploration: Plot the time series for currency to understand their trends, seasonality, and any anomalies.
3.	Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values or anomalies identified during the exploration phase.
Part 2: Model Building - ARIMA
1.	Parameter Selection for ARIMA: Utilize ACF and PACF plots to estimate initial parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model for one or more currency time series.
2.	Model Fitting: Fit the ARIMA model with the selected parameters to the preprocessed time series.
3.	Diagnostics: Analyze the residuals to ensure there are no patterns that might indicate model inadequacies.
4.	Forecasting: Perform out-of-sample forecasting and visualize the predicted values against the actual values.
Part 3: Model Building - Exponential Smoothing
1.	Model Selection: Depending on the time series characteristics, choose an appropriate Exponential Smoothing model (Simple, Holt’s Linear, or Holt-Winters).
2.	Parameter Optimization: Use techniques such as grid search or AIC to find the optimal parameters for the smoothing levels and components.
3.	Model Fitting and Forecasting: Fit the chosen Exponential Smoothing model and forecast future values. Compare these forecasts visually with the actual data.
Part 4: Evaluation and Comparison
1.	Compute Error Metrics: Use metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to evaluate the forecasts from both models.
2.	Model Comparison: Discuss the performance, advantages, and limitations of each model based on the observed results and error metrics.
3.	Conclusion: Summarize the findings and provide insights on which model(s) yielded the best performance for forecasting exchange rates in this dataset.
